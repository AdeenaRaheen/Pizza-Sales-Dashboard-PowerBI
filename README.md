# Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI project file (`.pbix`) for a comprehensive Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard. Developed to provide actionable insights into a pizza restaurant's operations, this dashboard answers key business questions related to sales, order volume, peak times, and popular products.

## **Project Overview**

This dashboard transforms raw transactional data into interactive visualizations, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand sales trends and operational efficiency. It addresses critical questions essential for strategic planning, resource allocation, and menu optimization within a fast-paced food service environment.

## **Key Features & Insights**

* **Overall Business Performance:** At-a-glance KPIs for Total Sales, Total Orders, and Total Pizzas Sold provide an immediate pulse on the business's health.
* **Hourly & Daily Order Volume Analysis:**
    * Identifies peak and low order times throughout the day (hourly and by broad time segments like Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
    * Highlights the busiest days of the week, crucial for staffing and inventory management.
* **Top Product Performance:**
    * Showcases the highest-ordered pizza by quantity.
    * Identifies the top 5 pizzas generating the most sales revenue, revealing the true financial drivers.
    * Pinpoints the hot-selling pizza categories.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Slicers for Date Range, Pizza Category, and Time of Day allow users to drill down into specific periods or product segments.
* **Advanced Tooltips:** A custom report page tooltip on the "Top 5 Pizzas by Sales Revenue" chart provides detailed insights on demand (e.g., total orders and quantity sold for a specific pizza) without cluttering the main view.
* **Clean & Professional Design:** Utilizes a custom, cohesive color palette and optimized layout for enhanced readability and user experience.


## **Technical Skills Demonstrated**

* **Data Modeling:** Established and verified robust relationships between multiple tables (Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, Pizza Types) to ensure accurate data flow and calculations.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Creation of complex measures (e.g., `Total Sales`, `Total Orders`, `Total Pizzas Sold`) for key performance indicators and analytical calculations.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Data loading, basic cleaning, and initial shaping of raw data.
* **Data Visualization:** Effective use of various chart types (Bar, Column, Line, Cards) to present data clearly and concisely.
* **Dashboard Design Principles:** Application of best practices for layout, color theory, visual hierarchy, and interactivity to create an intuitive and professional user interface.
* **Advanced Interactions:** Customization of visual interactions, including disallowing a slicer from filtering a specific chart to maintain an overall view.
* **Report Page Tooltips:** Implementation of advanced tooltips for on-demand detailed insights, enhancing user experience without visual clutter.
